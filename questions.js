const ANSWER1 = `
In the past week, we've identified three notable project airdrops, namely:

* [ ] **Starknet**  
  **Starknet** is set to revolutionize layer 2 solutions on Ethereum.
* [ ] **ZkSync**  
  **ZkSync** is pioneering zkRollups for scalability.
* [ ] **LayerZero**  
  **LayerZero** is creating a cross-chain interoperability protocol.</br>
There are a few crucial steps to follow:
1. Visit the official LayerZero website at www.layerzero.com.
2. Create a unique blockchain address through a trusted browser plug-in wallet or a secure script.
3. Engage with the LayerZero community by completing at least three transfers and acquiring an NFT from their ecosystem.
4. Ensure all these operations are completed before August 30th to be eligible for the snapshot and ultimately, the airdrop.
`;

const ANSWER23 = `
* Extremely cheap fees: (<$0.05)and fast transaction finality when compared to other leading amart contract platforms

* Incredibly well-funded project.

* Easy-to-use wallet and beginner:friendly UI helping to onboard crypto nevices.

* FTW collapse has strong mid-term negative effect on Solana price.

- High barrier to become validator due to hardware requirements and ongoing costs to maintain ($40.000-595.000 per year) lead to network centralization.

- "Monolithic laver:one" design, white highly performant now will struggle to seale into the millions of transactions per second.

- Network uptime and reliability suffer, including once shutting down the network completely for 17 hours.

const ANSWER3 = `
In analyzing Bitcoin's current dynamics, we maintain our strategy. We're eyeing long positions around the 29,000 mark, complemented by increased spot purchases. With the market showing a 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, it's an apt time to accumulate, preparing for an upward breakout.

In the ultra-short-term scenario, consider the exchange's liquidation chart. It displays abundant short positions suitable for liquidation. It's recommended to enter around 29,850, with profit-taking at 30,560, and placing a stop loss at 29,380.

Avoid round integer pending orders for better risk management. As market data evolves, our strategic points need adjusting.

const ANSWER4 = `
Upon examining the correlation between Ethereum (ETH) price fluctuations and ETH inflows and outflows on Binance, we unearth key insights that suggest a discernible pattern. Specifically, we notice substantial inflows and outflows aligning with significant price movements. For instance, an outflow of 17,500 ETH on May 11th and 13th corresponded to a drop in price to approximately 1785, whereas an inflow of 23,085 ETH on May 23rd coincided with a price hike to 1940.

The observed patterns potentially indicate that large inflows tend to precede price rises, while significant outflows may signal impending price drops, possibly driven by 'whale' transactions â€“ substantial trades by major holders that can influence the market.

Drawing from this analysis, we recommend that investors closely monitor such inflow and outflow activities, as they could serve as precursors to significant price movements. Investors might consider buying ahead of large inflows and selling prior to significant outflows.
